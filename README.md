# Document Capture System

This project is a document capture system designed to extract key information from driver's licenses using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The system is built using a Node.js backend and a React frontend, with MongoDB as the database for storing extracted data.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images of driver's licenses.
- **OCR Processing**: Extracts text data from images using an OCR service.
- **Data Validation**: Validates extracted data to ensure accuracy.
- **Database Storage**: Stores validated data in a MongoDB database.
- **API Endpoints**: Provides RESTful API endpoints for image upload and data retrieval.

## System Design

### High-Level Architecture

```
[User] -> [Frontend (React)] 
    -> [Backend (Node.js/Express)] 
        -> [OCR Service (e.g., Google Cloud Vision API Or Tesseract.js)] 
        -> [Data Validation] 
        -> [Database (MongoDB)]
```

### Components

1. **Frontend (React)**: 
   - Allows users to upload images.
   - Displays extracted data for verification.

2. **Backend (Node.js/Express)**:
   - Handles file uploads and processes images.
   - Integrates with an OCR service for text extraction.
   - Validates and stores data in MongoDB.

3. **OCR Service**:
   - Extracts text from uploaded images.

4. **Database (MongoDB)**:
   - Stores extracted and validated data.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/document-capture-system.git
   cd document-capture-system
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following variables:

   ```
   PORT=3000
   MONGODB_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string
   OCR_API_KEY=your_ocr_service_api_key
   ```

4. **Run the Backend Server**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Run the Frontend**

   Navigate to the frontend directory and start the React app:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

1. **Upload Image**: Use the frontend interface to upload an image of a driver's license.
2. **Process Image**: The backend processes the image, extracts data using OCR, validates it, and stores it in the database.
3. **View Data**: Extracted data is displayed on the frontend for user verification.
